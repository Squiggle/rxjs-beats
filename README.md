# Workshop: Beats by RX

Implementing a drum machine using Reactive Extensions.

This workshop is intended to introduce you to the basics of Reactive Extensions by building a drum machine using code.

# Build

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

# Ideas

- Subject that emits a 'tick' per bar
- Compliment that tick with 3 or 4 divisions (3/4 or 4/4 time signature?)
- Audio output subscribes
- Visual output subscribes
- Subject from various UI inputs - switch time signature, add a beat etc

? What does the visual output look like?
? What is the contract?

# TODO

## Groundwork

1. Vanilla JS/HTML5 scaffolding with Rollup
